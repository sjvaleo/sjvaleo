- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, my name is Salvatore Valeo. @sjvaleo,
  
- Iâ€™m interested in all kinds of software develpment and innovations to make tasks easier for human consumption.
I have spent multiple years studying coding and the unfathomable amount of work or data that computers are able to manage for us.

- I currently have experience using Python, Java, and SwiftUIKit/ Swift UI. I have also been learning the C and C+ programming languages.
  I have used these skills to help me in creating applications, games, and tools for people to use.
  
- This GitHub repository is used to showcase myself and highlight some of the projects that I have worked on over the years. 

- ðŸ“« You can reach me through my e-mail: sjvaleo@iu.edu
